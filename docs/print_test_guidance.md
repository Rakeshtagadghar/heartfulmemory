# Print Test Guidance (Sprint 9)

## Home print test
- Print 2-3 representative pages (text-heavy + image-heavy)
- Check margin safety and text clipping
- Compare digital vs hardcopy exports for image clarity

## Viewer validation
- Test in at least two viewers (Chrome + Acrobat/Edge)
- Zoom to 200% for text and image inspection

## Known limitations (v1)
- No bleed/spine/cover generator yet
- Export storage-to-R2 may be disabled depending on env/setup
- Preflight overlap detection is not fully implemented
