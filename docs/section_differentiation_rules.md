# Section Differentiation Rules v1 (Sprint 22)

## Objective
Make each chapter section read like a distinct part of a memoir chapter, not repeated paraphrases.

## Rules
- Opening
  - Set context with sensory detail + emotional tone.
  - No list formatting.
  - Avoid repeating the first line later.
- Story
  - Narrate events + people with grounded specifics from answers.
  - Do not repeat the opening sentence or summary phrasing.
- Timeline
  - Chronological sequence only from grounded answers.
  - If no dates exist, use sequence phrases (`First`, `Then`, `After that`).
  - Do not invent dates.
- Reflection
  - Focus on meaning, values, and lessons.
  - Avoid repeating facts already stated in Story/Timeline.

## Global Constraints
- No invented facts.
- No prompt leakage or writing instructions in user-visible text.
- No repeated sentence across sections.
