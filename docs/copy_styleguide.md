# Sprint 2 Copy Styleguide

Status: Implemented for Memorioso marketing pages (config-driven copy).

## Tone Guardrails
- Warm and family-first
- Modern and premium, never cold or corporate
- Clear about what exists now vs. "coming soon"
- Reassuring and practical (avoid hype claims)
- Avoid competitor names on-page

## Roadmap Feature Disclaimers (Required)
- QR playback / scan-to-relive: label as `Roadmap` or `coming soon`
- Hardcover printing: describe as future upgrade / coming soon
- Do not imply live availability in pricing or metadata

## Copy Tokens / Reuse
- Shared brand + landing copy lives in `apps/web/content/landingContent.ts`
- Reusable route copy configs live in `apps/web/content/*.ts`
- Variant-ready text tokens live in `apps/web/content/copyTokens.ts`

## Hero Variants (Future A/B Tests)
1. Turn family memories into a royal heirloom storybook.
2. Record family stories today. Pass down a keepsake for generations.

## Benefit Language Rules
- Lead with emotional outcome (preserve stories, pass down memories)
- Follow with practical mechanism (guided prompts, record or type, PDF export)
- Mention Phase 1 limits when relevant (PDF first, print/QR later)
