# Auth UX Copy (Sprint 3)

## Login Page Principles
- Use plain language: "Send magic link"
- Explain exactly what to do next (check inbox/spam)
- Avoid technical auth jargon
- Prefer one primary action on mobile

## Error Copy
- Invalid email: "Please enter a valid email address."
- Expired/invalid callback: "That sign-in link is invalid or expired. Request a new link."
- Missing config (dev): "Supabase auth is not configured yet. Add env vars to enable login."

## Success Copy
- "Magic link sent. Open your email on this device and continue."
- Resend cooldown text: `Resend in {n}s`
